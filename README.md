# Drawabot

*Tired of sucking at online video games that involve drawing? Well fear no more! One can draw any image with a bot that simulates real mouse down movements like a human (it doesn't look anything like a human)*

### Usage

1. `[CTRL] + [Click]` where you want to set the image
2. Input which pass you wish to use `R, G, B, A or V` (V stands for value in the `HSV` color model, it just takes the largest of R, G, and B)
3. Input brightness `threshold`
4. Input whether or not inverse should be used. By default, the bot will press `mousedown` on the pixels that have brightness above the `threshold`, inverse will swap that behavior.
5. Navigate back to the window you wish to paint on and `[Shift] + [Click]`
